## What is Econometrics

-   Defining characteristics of econometrics

    -   Observational data

    -   Use of regression analysis

-   Motivating statistical models with economic models

    -   Focus on causality

-   This class introduces you to linear regression

    -   Building block for many future economics classes

    -   You will use this technique in EC481

# The Linear Regression Model

## Introduction

-   Economic analysis often involves relating two or more variables

    -   Does age of school entry affect test scores?

    -   Does childhood health insurance affect adult health?

    -   Does foreign competition affect domestic innovation?

-   These relationships are typically used for

    -   <font color="red">**Causal Inference**</font>: the independent effect of one variable on another

    -   <font color="red">**Prediction**</font>: estimating value of one variable given values of another

-   Which one you use depends on goals of your analysis

    -   Causal inference is important in policy analysis

    -   Prediction is useful for guessing unknown values of a variable

-   We will develop a model to use for these goals

## What Are We Trying to Model?

-   We want to relate test scores to class size

-   Hard to do this for specific individuals

    -   Many reasons why test scores differ between people

    -   Even people in same class sizes have very different scores

-   Instead focus on the <font color="red">systematic</font> relationship

-   We do this by focusing on average test scores

    -   How do average test scores change with class size?

-   Several reasons to use the average

    -   Highlights systematic patterns between variables

    -   It is mathematically optimal way to predict a variable given another

    -   Intuitively appealing

## What Are We Trying to Model?

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Mathematically we focus on the [**Conditional Expectation**]{.red}

-   In the context of test scores, the conditional expectation is $$ E[TestScore | STR] $$

-   This is the average test score for each class size

-   $STR$ is Student Teacher Ratio, a measure of class size

**Reminder about Expected Values**

-   The **Expected Value** $E[Y]$ of a random variable $Y$ is its weighted average

-   The **Conditional Expectation** $E[Y|X]$ is the weighted average of a variable $Y$ at specific values of another variable $X$

## What Are We Trying to Model?

-   Big problem: we do not know how average test scores relate to class size

    -   Could be linear

    -   Could be non-linear

    -   Could some other weird function

-   Unfortunately, we will [never know]{.red} exactly how they relate `r emo::ji("sad")`

-   Instead we approximate this relationship

-   In EC295 our we use linear models for the approximation

    -   Often a good guess at true relationship

    -   But unknown true model is probably more complicated

## The Population Linear Regression Model

-   A linear model relating test scores to each class size is $$TestScore = \beta_{0} + \beta_{STR}STR + u$$

-   Several important components of this model

    -   $TestScore$ are individual test scores

    -   STR are individual class sizes

    -   $\beta_{STR}$ is the [slope]{.red}

        -   Effect of one-unit change in class size on test scores

    -   $\beta_{0}$ is the [intercept]{.red} parameter

        -   Test scores when class size is zero

    -   $u$ is everything except class size that determines test scores
