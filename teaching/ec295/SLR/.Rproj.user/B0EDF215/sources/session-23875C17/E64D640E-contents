## What is Econometrics

- Defining characteristics of econometrics

  - Observational data
  
  - Use of regression analysis
  
- Motivating statistical models with economic models
  
  - Focus on causality
  
- This class introduces you to linear regression

  - Building block for many future economics classes
  
  - You will use this technique in EC481


---

## Introduction to Linear Regression

- Economic analysis often involves relating two or more variables

  - Does age of school entry affect test scores?
  
  - Does childhood health insurance affect adult health?
  
  - Does foreign competition affect domestic innovation?
  
- These relationships are typically used for 

  - <font color="red">**Causal Inference**</font>: the independent effect of one variable on another
  
  - <font color="red">**Prediction**</font>: estimating value of one variable given values of another

- Which one you use depends on goals of your analysis
  
  - Causal inference is important in policy analysis
  
  - Prediction is useful for guessing unknown values of a variable

- We will develop a model to use for these goals

---

## Context

- A big issue in education is the size of school classes

- Parents often in favour of smaller classes  

  - More attention paid to individual students  
  
  - Classes easier to control  
  
  - Can do more interactive work  
  
- But, smaller classes are more expensive 

  - More teaching resources per student 
  
- Important to measure benefit of smaller classes  

  - Compare against cost to see if worthwhile  
  
- Book repeatedly discusses models in context of class size and student performance  

---

## What Are We Trying to Model?

- We want to relate test scores to class size

- Hard to do this for specific individuals

  - Many reasons why test scores differ between people
  
  - Even people in same class sizes have very different scores 
  
- Instead focus on the <font color="red">systematic</font> relationship

- We do this by focusing on average test scores

  - How do average test scores change with class size?
 
- Several reasons to use the average
  
  - Highlights systematic patterns between variables
  
  - It is mathematically optimal way to predict a variable given another
  
  - Intuitively appealing

---

## What Are We Trying to Model?

.pull-left[
- Mathematically we focus on the .red[**Conditional Expectation**]

- In the context of test scores, the conditional expectation is
$$ E[TestScore | STR] $$

- This is the average test score for each class size
- $STR$ is Student Teacher Ratio, a measure of class size
]

.pull-right[
.content-box-red[
### Reminder about Expected Values

The **Expected Value** $E[Y]$ of a random variable $Y$ is its weighted average



The **Conditional Expectation** $E[Y|X]$ is the weighted average of a variable $Y$ at specific values of another variable $X$
]
]
---

## What Are We Trying to Model?

- Big problem: we do not know how average test scores relate to class size

  - Could be linear
  
  - Could be non-linear
  
  - Could some other weird function
  
- Unfortunately, we will .red[.bolder[never know]] exactly how they relate `r emo::ji("sad")`

- Instead we approximate this relationship

- In EC295 our we use linear models for the approximation

  - Often a good guess at true relationship
  
  - But unknown true model is probably more complicated

---

## The Linear Regression Model

- A linear model relating test scores to each class size is
	$$TestScore = \beta_{0} + \beta_{STR}STR + u$$

- Several important components of this model
  
  - $TestScore$ are individual test scores
  
  - STR are individual class sizes
  
  - $\beta_{STR}$ is the .red[slope] 
	 
      - Effect of one-unit change in class size on test scores
 
  - $\beta_{0}$ is the .red[intercept] parameter
	 
      - Test scores when class size is zero
    
  - $u$ is everything except class size that determines test scores
---

   
## The Linear Regression Model

.pull-left[
This model breaks test scores in to two pieces

1. .red[Population Regression Function]
$$\beta_{0} + \beta_{STR}STR$$
  The predictable part of test scores
  
2. .red[Error Term]
$$u = TestScore - \beta_{0} - \beta_{STR}STR$$
  The unobserved and unpredictable part of test scores
]

.pull-right[
```{r prf, fig.align="center"}
set.seed(9810078)
data <- data.frame(eta=rnorm(10,0,20), str = rnorm(10,20,5)) %>%
  mutate(testscore = 700 -2*str + eta )
  

prfplot <- data %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=str, y=testscore)) +
  geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.8) +

```
]

## The Linear Regression Model 

- Another big problem: We do not know the values of $\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{STR}$

  - They are parameters that we do not observe
  
- We also do not observe $u$

  - The unobserved error term
 
- Suppose we need to know these parameters   
- How do we proceed from here?

- Answer: we .red[**estimate**] $\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{STR}$ with a sample of data

  - There are several estimation methods
  
  - We will focus on .red[**Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**]

---

## Drawing a Sample from the Population 
 
- To estimate our model, we need to collect data on test scores and class sizes 

- Imagine collecting a sample of size $n$
 
  - e.g. test scores and class sizes from 50 classes in different schools
  
  - $n = 50$ in this case

- The population regression model holds .red[for each member of the sample]
$$TestScore_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{STR}STR_{i} + u_{i}$$
   - The subscript $i$ identifies a specific member of the sample

- Test scores are assumed to be linearly related to class size for each member of the sample

---

## Ordinary Least Squares

.content-box-blue[
**Ordinary Least Squares**

A method that estimates regression parameters by choosing the ones that minimize the sum of the squared distance between the estimated regression line and each data point
]

- To implement OLS, replace the unknowns of the population model with estimates
$$TestScore_{i} = \hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{STR}STR_{i} + \hat{u}_{i}$$
  - $\hat{\beta}_{0}$ estimates $\beta_{0}$
  
  - $\hat{\beta}_{STR}$ estimates $\beta_{STR}$
  
  - $\hat{u}_{i}$ is the residual (estimates the error)
		 
- OLS .red[chooses] $\hat{\beta}_{0}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{STR}$ to minimize the sum of the squared residual
 
---

## Ordinary Least Squares
- The sum of the squared residual is

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \hat{u}_{i}^{2} =  \sum_{i=1}^{n} (TestScore_{i} - \hat{\beta}_{0} - \hat{\beta}_{1}STR_{i} )^{2}$$
- To solve, take derivative<sup>1</sup> above with respect to $\hat{\beta}_{0}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{1}$ and set to zero

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} (TestScore_{i} - \hat{\beta}_{0} - \hat{\beta}_{STR}STR_{i}) = 0$$
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} (TestScore_{i} - \hat{\beta}_{0} - \hat{\beta}_{STR}STR_{i})STR_{i} = 0$$

- These are the .red[OLS Normal Equations]


.footnotesize[
.footnote[
1. If you don't know calculus, don't worry about it.  I will not ask you to take a derivative in this class.
]]

---

## Ordinary Least Squares

- Use these equations to solve for $\hat{\beta}_{0}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{STR}$

.content-box-blue[
**Ordinary Least Squares Estimators (for our example)**

$$\hat{\beta}_{0} = \overline{TestScore} - \hat{\beta}_{1}\overline{STR}$$
$$\hat{\beta}_{STR} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(STR_{i} - \overline{STR})(TestScore_{i} - \overline{TestScore})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(STR_{i} - \overline{STR})^2} = \frac{\widehat{cov}(STR_{i}, TestScore_{i})}{\widehat{var}(STR_{i})}$$
]


- The estimates of the intercept and slope based on our sample

- `r emo::ji("boom")`.red[**Important**]`r emo::ji("boom")`: these will differ from one sample to another

  - We will return to sampling variation later


---

## Ordinary Least Squares

.pull-left[
The estimated model has its own terminology

1. .red[Sample Regression Function]
$$\hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{STR}STR$$
The line constructed with the OLS estimators

2. .red[Predicted Value]
$$\widehat{TestScore}_{i} = \hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{STR}STR_{i}$$
The value of $TestScore_{i}$ implied by the sample regression function

3. .red[Residual]
$$\hat{u}_{i} = TestScore_{i} - \hat{\beta}_{0} - \hat{\beta}_{STR}STR_{i}$$
The difference between the actual value of $TestScore_{i}$ and its prediction

## General Model

- So far we have used a specific example

- A population regression function for any outcome and any independent variable is

$$Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X + u$$
.pull-left[.content-box-blue[
**Ordinary Least Squares Estimators**

$$\hat{\beta}_{0} = \overline{Y} - \hat{\beta}_{1}\overline{X}$$
$$\hat{\beta}_{1} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_{i} - \overline{X})(Y_{i} - \overline{Y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_{i} - \overline{X})^2} = \frac{\widehat{cov}(X_{i}, Y_{i})}{\widehat{var}(X_{i})}$$
]]

.pull-right[.content-box-blue[
**Sample Regression Function**
$$\hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{1}X$$

**Predicted Value**
$$\widehat{Y}_{i} = \hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{STR}X_{i}$$
**Residual**
$$\hat{u}_{i} = Y_{i} - \hat{\beta}_{0} - \hat{\beta}_{1}X_{i}$$
]]

## Example: The Effect of Class Size on Test Scores

- **Question:** .red[Are class size and student achievement related?]

- We will create .red[simulated data] to explore the relationship

	- We set the process generating the data
	
	- Lets us control the true values of the parameters
	
	- We set these values to create realistic data


- The simulated data will mimic actual data we see on test scores

- We will use this dataset to explore linear regression

	- We will see mechanics of estimation
	
	- Also how sampling variation affects estimates
---

## Example: The Effect of Class Size on Test Scores

- Suppose the population regression function is
$$TestScore_{i}= \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}STR_{i} + u_{i}$$
  - $\beta_{1}$ is effect of one more student per teacher
  
  - $\beta_{0}$ is test score when class size is zero
  
      - Does not have a useful interpretation in this example

- $u$ are determinants of test scores other than student-teacher ratio

  - Natural ability
  
  - Student background
  
  - School/teacher quality
  
  - etc
---

## Example: Effect of Class Size on Test Scores

.pull-left[
- Set the population regression equation as 
$$TestScore= 700 - 2*STR + u$$
  - Says that  $\beta_{0} = 700$, $\beta_{1} = -2$

  - These are .red[fictional] population values

      - In reality we would never know these
      
      - We are pretending we know them for instructional reasons
]

.pull-right[
```{r ex1, fig.align="center"}
linfun <- function(x) {
  y = 700 - 2*x
  return(y)
}

ex1 <- ggplot() +
  xlim(9,25) +
  ylim(625, 700) +

## Example: Effect of Class Size on Test Scores

- Next step is to estimate $\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{1}$ 

  - As though we did not know their values
 
- First take sample of data from population

- We will draw .red[420 observations] with a .red[simple random sample]

- Stata code on right

gen testscr = 700 -2.5 * str + u

## Example: Effect of Class Size on Test Scores

- Before estimating parameters, summarize the data 

.content-box-green[
**Stata Code and Output**   
```{stata, echo=TRUE, collectcode=TRUE}
sum testscr str
```
]
- Note scale of test scores
		 
  - Simulate scores from a standardized test
  
  - Standardized tests often scaled to have mean 650, standard deviation 20

- Roughly 20 students per teacher in these fictional districts

## Example: Effect of Class Size on Test Scores

- Estimate intercept and slope by OLS 

.content-box-green[
**Stata Code and Output**   
```{stata, echo=TRUE, collectcode=TRUE}
regress testscr str
```
]

---

## Example: Effect of Class Size on Test Scores

- The OLS estimates are
$$\hat{\beta}_{1} = -1.86$$
$$\hat{\beta}_{0} = 696.49$$
		 
- The sample regression function is
$$\widehat{TestScore}= 696.49 - 1.86STR$$

  - Use to generate predictions of test scores
  
  - Simply plug in a value for $STR$, and compute $\widehat{TestScore}$
